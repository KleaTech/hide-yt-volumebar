# About

This userscript restores focus to video element after using volume bar, so that left/right arrows can be used for video seeking instead of volume change.
Requires userscript manager like Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey.

## Before

Without this script, when clicking on volume bar, it keeps the focus. Pressing left or right arrow key changes volume level.

After applying this script, when clicking on volume bar, the video element takes focus. Pressing left or right arrow key seeks forward or backward. You can still press up and down arrow keys to change volume level.
